# Sign-up Form

A sign-up form for an imaginary service created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. This project involved recreating an existing [design template](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/afdbabfab03fbc34783c6b6f3920aba4a4d3b935/intermediate_html_css/forms/project_sign_up_form/imgs/sign-up-form.png) to practice HTML and CSS skills.

**Note:** This project includes some responsive elements but is not optimized for mobile displays. Additionally, this form includes minimal HTML validation but is not connected to JavaScript or any backend server.
